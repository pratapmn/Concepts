 * Given a character limit and a message, split the message up into annotated chunks without cutting words as,
 * for example when sending the SMS "Hi Sivasrinivas, your Uber is arriving now!" with char limit 25, you should get
 * ["Hi Sivasrinivas,(1/3)", "your Uber is arriving(2/3)", "now!(3/3)"]
